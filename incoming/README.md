# Daily digest delivery

Create one UTF-8 Markdown file here for each daily selection:

`incoming/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Start with `# arXiv-YYYY-MM-DD` and a brief daily overview, followed by 10–20 consecutively ranked item headings:
`## arXiv-YYYY-MM-DD — Item N`.

Each item must include a `###` paper title, authors and `arXiv:YYMM.NNNNN`,
summary paragraphs, `**Background.**`, and
`**Why it matters for you:**`.

Ten papers is the default; include additional papers only when warranted, with a
hard limit of twenty. Do not include priority verdicts such as “must read” or
“high.” Legacy digests containing priority lines remain supported.

The existing GitHub Pages workflow automatically parses, validates, and publishes
these files. No model API calls or generated-JSON commits are needed. A malformed
entry fails the build and leaves the previous successful website in place.

Do not overwrite earlier dates. If the same date also exists in `content/digests/`,
the substantive content must agree; the reviewed JSON's topic tags take precedence.

The complete cloud-task prompt is in `prompts/cloud-daily-selection.md`.
