# Daily digest delivery

Create one UTF-8 Markdown file here for each daily selection:

`incoming/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Start with `# arXiv-YYYY-MM-DD`, followed by exactly ten item headings:
`## arXiv-YYYY-MM-DD — Item N`.

Each item must include a `###` paper title, authors and `arXiv:YYMM.NNNNN`,
`**Priority: ...**`, summary paragraphs, `**Background.**`, and
`**Why it matters for you:**`.

The existing GitHub Pages workflow automatically parses, validates, and publishes
these files. No model API calls or generated-JSON commits are needed. A malformed
entry fails the build and leaves the previous successful website in place.

Do not overwrite earlier dates. If the same date also exists in `content/digests/`,
the substantive content must agree; the reviewed JSON's topic tags take precedence.

The complete cloud-task prompt is in `prompts/cloud-daily-selection.md`.
